## Course Description

This course will provide in-depth, hands-on experience with administration of Linux-based operating systems, including installation, configuration, and documentation of system components. Topics covered will span aspects of security, access, authentication, and network setup and troubleshooting, as well as the automation thereof. The primary objective is to provide fluency in practical administration and system design strategies in the IT industry.

## Pre-requisites

### Courses

- CSC 160 Computing Technologies

### Reading

This course is intended for students with a basic knowledge of Linux and its most common utilities and text editors. For students with no prior experience watch the free [‘Introduction to Linux’](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-1) course.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the course the student will be fluent in the automation of Linux system configuration, as well as the troubleshooting of Linux application and networking issues. They will understand Linux design concepts such as network protocols, security, and other associated technologies. The student will be prepared with the tools and concepts needed to efficiently build and manage an enterprise Linux infrastructure. They will be able to apply this foundation of knowledge and hands on experience to the obtaining of a profession in the IT industry. The application of administration theory and experience through hands-on lab exercises creates a foundation of the skills required in any computer science degree and profession. The results should include actual job skills that can translate into employment opportunities including Linux system administration.

## Methods of Assessment

Assessment will be based on classroom participation in discussions of networking technology and delivering a networking research paper and presentation. Also, in class quizzes will be issued in Friday classes with a mid-term and final exam.

## Attendance Policy

Class attendance is mandatory. It is expected that each student be present for class and prepared to contribute to the class discussion and on their group project(s). All scheduled classes are required. If you have a conflict, discuss it with the instructor prior to your absence, or through an e-mail. When you miss class, you miss out on important details, changes to the syllabus, and new assignments, not to mention the opportunity for a deeper understanding of class topics. As such, when you are absent your “Class Participation” grade will be reduced.

## Late Submission Policy

Late work affects timely feedback in class and entry of grades at St. Martin’s University. As such the instructor retains total discretion to award either full, or partial, or “no” credit for work/tests that are submitted late with no notice from the student. If you have a legitimate issue/conflict that you are aware of, in advance, that will impede you from taking a test on time, this must be discussed with your instructor prior to the due date. These issues will be assessed on a case by case basis (Students who need more time to complete tests for valid reasons can also request – before the due date – an exception for “full credit” consideration). Students who do not communicate with the instructor about late submissions will see no grade in the Moodle book for a time – usually two weeks. After that, the instructor normally enters “zero points” in the Moodle gradebook, and except in very special circumstances, points that are entered in the Moodle gradebook are final.

## Administrative Requirements

### Disabilities Support Service Explanation

Access/Disability Services:  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) mandates colleges and universities to provide "reasonable accommodation" to any enrolled student with a disability.  The law protects the student's rights to have an equalized opportunity for learning and for participating in campus programs and activities.  Students have the right to services and reasonable accommodations providing they meet the basic requirements to perform activities of the program.  Saint Martin's University Student Services includes a Disability Support Services office which works with students and potential students.  We arrange those accommodations that allow our students to participate in classes and activities and have equal access to a full education here at the university alongside their fellow students, in whatever format the class is offered.  
Students with medically recognized and documented (permanent or temporary) disabilities and who are in need of accommodation have an obligation to notify the University of their needs.  If you need accommodations because of a disability, if you have emergency medical information that would be helpful for me to know, or if you need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please let me know.

### Academic Dishonesty Policy

Saint Martin's University and your instructor appreciate integrity and honesty.  Please use your own thoughts, words, and ideas for your assignments.  PLAGIARISM will NOT be tolerated.  If quoting from the work of another author, please give credit by acknowledging it in your paper using quotation marks and citing the information sources. For example:  "direct quote (Author’s last name, 2019, page number)".  When paraphrasing (or rephrasing) the work of another author, acknowledge by citing the information source.  For example:  paraphrased comments (Author’s last name, 2019)

Academic dishonesty consists of any of the following acts:  Assisting another student on examinations, tests, quizzes or other assignments, or receiving assistance from a student without permission of the instructor.  Using unauthorized materials for assistance during examinations, tests or quizzes or other assignments.

#### Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the act of using the words and ideas of others without giving proper credit. Common varieties of plagiarism include:

- Having another individual write a paper or take an examination for a student
- Directly quoting material without using quotation marks or proper indentation
- Not giving credit for another person's original ideas and organization
  - See page 60-61 of the 2019-2020 undergraduate academic catalog

Plagiarism and cheating are considered unethical actions and a violation of academic policy. The procedures for dealing with these cases are outlined in the Saint Martin's University Student Handbook.

### Request for an Incomplete Grade

The grade of "I" means incomplete and is given for work, which is of passing quality but which, because of circumstances beyond the student's control, is not complete.  A student must request an incomplete grade in writing prior to the last week of the semester.  The request must be submitted on the University “I” Grade request Form to the course instructor and must specify the reason for the request.  The issuance of the grade of “I” is at the discretion of the faculty member teaching the course.  Instructors may grant “I” grades to students as long as 50% of the course work has been completed and the student has a justifiable cause such as deployment, illness, family emergency, etc.  The approved “I” Grade Request Form must include specific work required to remove the incomplete.  If the instructor approves, the Office of the Registrar must receive a copy of the “I” Grade Request Form.  The [“I” Grade Request Form](https://www.stmartin.edu/forms?topic=Registrar)

#### Removal of an Incomplete Grade

The removal of an "I" grade is the student's responsibility.  All coursework must be completed according to the terms agreed to on the “I” Grade Request Form. An “I” grade will remain on the student's transcript for one (1) regular semester (Fall or Spring) beyond the semester in which the "I" was entered.  At the conclusion of that one semester, the grade of “I” will be converted into a grade of "F" unless the instructor has submitted a grade change.
